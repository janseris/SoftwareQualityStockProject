1. Install SQL Server Express (any version)
- https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2216019&clcid=0x409&culture=en-us&country=us
- instalation: install as a named instance of name "SQLEXPRESS" to be able to use the server URL "./SQLEXPRESS" in connection string for the local SQL Server Express instance
  - if the SQL Server Express instance is named differently, server URL in the connection string has to be modified appropriately

2. Install SQL Server Management Studio
- https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup

3. Connect to the local SQL Server Express instance in SSMS
- server URL: ./SQLEXPRESS (where . represents "this computer" and SQLEXPRESS is the name of the SQL Server Express named instance (default = SQLEXPRESS)
- authentication: Windows/Integrated Authentication (no username and password)

4. Attach the .mdf file (database file)
- if .ldf file is not stored in the same directory as the .mdf file, it will be created for SQL Server working purposes
- if .ldf file is found in the same directory, it will be used by SQL Server

You should have now your database added to the running SQL Server Express instance on your computer.
